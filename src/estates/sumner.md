The Sumner estate was demolished as part of the Five Estates North Peckham regeneration. It was built partly in the interwar period (13 blocks, 535 dwellings) and partly in the early 1950s (nine blocks, 247 dwellings) - a total of 782 dwellings over 22 blocks, from four to six storeys high.

The Sumner was the oldest of the Five Estates and of a type familiar across London - low rise, red brick and built in a traditional architectural style by the [London County Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_County_Council).
