In 2009, the Wood dene blocks of the Acorn estate comprising 323 homes were demolished. The site was sold to Notting Hill Genesis housing association, which has built 333 new homes of which 54 were approved as social rent. As with Notting Hill's other schemes, we [have shown](https://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) that were instead delivered as affordable rent - i.e. up to 80% market rent.
