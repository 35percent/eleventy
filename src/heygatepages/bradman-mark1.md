Southwark Council selects a development partner, property developer Godfrey Bradman and starts working up a masterplan for the regeneration. It is July 2000 before the plans are first presented to Heygate residents.

Bradman delivers a [presentation](http://betterelephant.github.io/images/slrpresentation.pdf) to the Heygate TRA saying: _"This whole project is only possible by you, the Heygate residents. We understand that it is the redevelopment of the existing housing on the Heygate estate which provides the opportunity to regenerate the Elephant & Castle - and we are committed to providing new and better homes for you and your families who currently live here."_

Bradman's presentation promises _"100% reprovision of all the council homes currently on the Heygate estate"._ This is subsequently echoed in the [2002 masterplan](https://35percent.org/img/slrplans.pdf):

The proposals were subsequently cemented in planning policy. The [2003 SPG - Framework for Development](https://heygatewashome.org/img/Executive_22April2003.pdf) promised 28.5% social rented housing, comprising a total of 1200 units at E&C:__

The Council's [Regeneration Magazine](https://issuu.com/3foxinternational/docs/southwark_3) trumpeted that 50% of new homes at Elephant and Castle would be affordable:

After two years of negotiations, Southwark [pulls the plug](http://betterelephant.github.io/images/elephantsgraveyard.pdf) on the Godfrey Bradman scheme citing disputes over the profit share arrangement as the cause. The council instructs MAKE architects to draw up a [new masterplan](http://www.scribd.com/doc/82420796/Southwark-Council-2004-Development-Framework) and starts the process of seeking a new development partner.

In the event, just 100 of the 2,924 new homes on the redeveloped Heygate estate have been provided as social rented homes and [just 298 of the 5,937](https://www.35percent.org/opportunity/) homes in the major schemes at Elephant and Castle will be social rent.
