In 2012, global architect, planning and consulting firm Gensler entered a competition organised by Building Trust International. The HOME competition – was a project focused on providing residents most at risk in developed cities with a safe place to live. The competition’s task was to create an urban dwelling for under £20k, and it resulted in over 450 applications.

Global architect firm Gensler completes a [design and cost appraisal study](https://35percent.org/img/genslerheygate.pdf) showing that it would save 40k tonnes of C02 and cost just £35m to redesign and refurbish the estate.

The Gensler proposals showed how the estate could be renovated for just £13,955 per home. The total cost of renovating the 1,200 homes on the estate would therefore be less than Southwark Council have already spent on emptying it.

The study also showed how refurbishment would save approximately 40,000 tonnes of CO2 and the 450 mature trees on the Heygate site.
