Despite a policy requirement of 35%, the [Regeneration Agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) signed by the council leader in 2010 stipulated that Lendlease was to provide _"A minimum of 25 per cent Affordable Housing"_(pg 95), which is _"to be divided equally between Social Rented Housing and Intermediate Affordable Housing"_(page 1).

However, when the planning application was submitted in Jan 2013, it propsed 25% affordable housing but Lendlease had substituted most of the social rent component for [affordable rent](https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2014/feb/03/affordable-housing-meaning-rent-social-housing) of up to 80% market on the grounds of financial viability.

The figures [showed](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) how Lendlease had cooked the books to make the development look unviable and thereby negotiate down its affordable housing obligations.

As a result, of the 2,924 new homes on the Heygate, 198 will be intermediate 'affordable rent', 316 shared ownership and just 100 will be social rented. This is a breach of the terms of the contractual agreement with Lendlease, which would have provided for circa 500 social rented homes had it been adhered to.
